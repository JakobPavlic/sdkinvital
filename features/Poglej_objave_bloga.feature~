Feature: User can acces blog posts

As someone who wants to meet new people
So that I can get a feel for the kind of people that are enrolled
I want to read blog posts

Background: Blog posts are in the database

Given the following posts exist:
|title|content|instructor|
|Prva objava|Bilo je lepo|{:id => 1, :name => "Damjan Vrenčur", :picture => "Slika", :description => "Puščavnik", :phone_number => "233421"}|
